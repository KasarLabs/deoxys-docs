# Synchronization

## There are three main synchronization modes

* snap sync
	* the fastest way to sync to the network (syncs to mainnet in \~3 hours)
	* downloads only the latest state, headers, and optionally bodies and receipts
* fast sync
	* slower than snap sync
	* useful on nethermind-only chains (like Gnosis), where snap sync is not available for now
	* downloads only the latest state, headers, and optionally bodies and receipts
* archive sync
	* heavy historical sync verifying all the transactions and keeping all the historical state
	* you can run it like this `./Nethermind.Runner --config mainnet_archive`

| Sync Mode                                                  | Disk Space needed | Full current state | Full current and all historical states | Can sync a full archive node from this | Time to sync | Time to RPC |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| archive                                                    | \~12TB            | YES                | YES                                    | YES                                    | \~3 weeks    | \~3 weeks   |
| snap/fast sync with all bodies and receipts                | \~800GB           | YES                | NO                                     | YES                                    | \~20 hours   | \~20 hours  |
| default snap/fast sync (with barriers set to support Eth2) | \~500GB           | YES                | NO                                     | NO                                     | \~11 hours   | \~11 hours  |

## Snap Sync

Snap sync allows a node to perform the initial synchronization and download of Ethereumâ€™s state up to 10 times faster
than using fast sync.

#### How to Enable

Snap sync is enabled by default for majority of networks. To make sure, check if`SnapSync` is set to `true` in the Sync
module of your `.cfg` file

```
"Sync": {
	"SnapSync": true
}
```
