# Synchronization

## Synchronization modes

- Snap Sync
  - Available using the **`--snap <BLOCK_NUMBER>`** command
  - The fastest way to sync to the desired network
  - Download the same state as full sync but starts from the desired and available snapshots
  - It is less secure than full sync (please only use snapshots from trusted parties)
- Full Sync
  - Sync from the genesis of the desired network
  - Slower than snap sync
  - Downloads the entire state excepting receipts
- Archive Sync
  - Sync from the genesis of the desired network
  - The slowest way to sync the desired network
  - Heavy storage usage
  - Not available on Madara nodes yet

| Sync Mode | Disk Space needed | Full current state | Full current and all receipts | Time to sync | Time to RPC |
| --------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Snap      | \~12TB            | YES                | NO                            | \~4 hours    | \~4 hours   |
| Full      | \~800GB           | YES                | NO                            | \~72 hours   | \~72 hours  |
| Archive   | n\a               | YES                | YES                           | n\a          | n\a         |

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Syncing a node in Full or Snap sync doesn't means you don't have access to
  receipts, those are reexecuted and generated internally by the node when
  required.

## Addtional modes

They're some additional modes you may want to use when syncing a Madara instance, for exemple for dev purposes

- Disable state root
  - Available using the **`--disable-root`** command
  - Doesn't compute commitments
  - Syncs more than 3x faster than a Full Sync
  - The fastest way to sync to the desired network (yes we lied above :)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Syncing a node in `--disable-root` means that you're not verifying the
  integrity of the state you're currently syncing. Only do it if you're aware of
  what you're doing.
