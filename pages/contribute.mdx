  Have an idea of an ambitious hack related to one module of the client ? Such as an optimization update or a fixing issue ?
  Go ahead and create a discussion on the GitHub repo, if all good you'll be invited to present it at one community call and then start implementing it!

## Developers

Deoxys contributions are rewarded through [OnlyDust](https://app.onlydust.xyz/).<br></br>
*What does that mean ?* It means that you as a developer are free to pick any open issue and submit a PR. Once the PR is merged you will be paid according to the time/difficulty of the PR.
For now, Deoxys team does not look for new contributors, but this could change in the future. If you are interested in joining the team, please reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/kasarlabs).
## Bug Hunting

Found a bug ? Please submit an [issue](https://github.com/KasarLabs/deoxys/issues) on GitHub so any open source contributor can look at it and fix it (you can too!)

## Documentation

Missing anything in these docs ? Spotted a typo ? Please submit a PR or create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/kasarLabs/deoxys-docs/). As everything we do, we grow together and the more eyes we have looking at it the better it will be.
