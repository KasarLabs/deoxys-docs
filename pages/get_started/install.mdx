# Installing Madara

In this section, we will guide you through the build and run process so that you can run your own Madara client, and query the Starknet blockchain as smoothly as possible.

We want anyone to be able to launch a Madara full node, which is why we've divided this section into 3 difficulty levels:

- [**Low-level**](#low-level-installation-from-source) (from source directly)
- [**Mid-level**](#mid-level-installation) (from Docker **recomanded**)
- [**High-level**](#high-level-installation-clicknplay) (Coming soon)

## Low level Installation

## From source

<Steps>
### Install dependencies

We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

| Dependency        | Version              | Installation                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| rust              | rustc 1.74.0-nightly | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs sh`   |

You can use this command to easily install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s
```

### Get code

Fetch the code from the Official [Madara](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara) repository in the folder of your choice.

```bash
cd <your-destination-path>
git clone https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara .
```

### Build program

Then let's build the dependencies. You can choose between 3 differents build modes:

- **Debug** (fastest build mode, but lower performances, for testing purpose only)

```bash
cargo build
```

- **Release** (the recomanded build mode with production performances)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run Madara

This command will start the Madara client with a basic set arguments which will begin the synchronization with Starknet mainnet automatically:

```bash
cargo run --release \
  --name Madara \
  --base-path /var/lib/madara \
  --network main \
  --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  We recomand you to head up to the [Configuration](/) section to custom your
  node parameters
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you don't have an L1 endpoint url we recomand you to head up to the
  [Verification](/) section to get one
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Mid level installation

This is the recomanded way to easily install and run Madara it only requires a terminal access.

## Using Docker

<Steps>

### Install Docker

{/* prettier-ignore */}

<Tabs items={["MacOS", "Linux", "Windows"]}>
  <Tab>
    **MacOS**: To install Docker on MacOS, follow these steps: 1. Visit the
    [Docker
    Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/) and
    download Docker Desktop for Mac. 2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and drag
    the Docker icon to your Applications folder to begin the installation. 3.
    Once installed, launch Docker from your Applications folder. Docker will
    request your admin password to complete the setup. 4. After installation,
    you can open a terminal and run `docker --version` to verify that Docker has
    been installed successfully.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **Linux**: Docker installation on Linux varies by distribution, but here are
    the general steps: 1. Update your package manager index by running `sudo
    apt-get update` (This command is for distributions using `apt` like Ubuntu
    or Debian). 2. Install prerequisite packages which allow `apt` to use
    packages over HTTPS: `sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ca-certificates curl software-properties-common`. 3. Add Docker's official
    GPG key: `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo
    apt-key add -`. 4. Verify that you now have the key with the fingerprint by
    searching for the last 8 characters of the fingerprint. 5. Set up the Docker
    repository by running `sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64]
    https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"`. 6.
    Update the `apt` package index again: `sudo apt-get update`. 7. Install
    Docker: `sudo apt-get install docker-ce`. 8. To verify Docker is installed
    correctly, run `docker run hello-world`. Note: The above commands are
    tailored for Ubuntu. Please adjust for your particular Linux distribution.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    **Windows**: To install Docker on Windows, ensure you meet the following
    requirements: - Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build
    15063 or later). - Hyper-V and Containers Windows features must be enabled.
    Here are the steps: 1. Visit the [Docker
    Hub](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows/)
    to download Docker Desktop for Windows. 2. Run the downloaded Docker Desktop
    installer. 3. Follow the installation instructions. You might be prompted to
    logout and log back in, or reboot your computer before you can use Docker.
    4. After installation, run Docker by searching for it in the Start menu and
    selecting Docker Desktop. 5. To verify Docker has been installed, open a
    command prompt and enter `docker --version`. Note: If your system does not
    support Hyper-V or if you are running Windows 10 Home, you may need to
    install Docker Toolbox instead.

### Run docker image

Once you have successfully installed Docker, you can now run Madara using the images available here: [Madara-v0.1.0-nightly](https://link).
You can replace the `--rpc-port`, `--base-path` with your desired parameters.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This is a default configuration. For more information on possible
  configurations, please visit the
  [Configuration](../fundamentals/configuration) section.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Make sure to change the volume `-v` of your container if you change the
  `--base-path`.
</Callout>

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name Madara
  -p 9944:9944 \
  -v /var/lib/madara:/var/lib/madara \
  madara:latest \
  --base-path /var/lib/Madara \
  --network main \
  --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you don't have an L1 endpoint url we recomand you to head up to the
  [Verification](/) section to get one
</Callout>

### Check logs

```bash
docker logs -f madara
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Now you can head up to the [Metrics](/) section to easily deploy a Grafana and
  Prometheus dashboard
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Using Docker Compose

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. You can follow the installation instructions for Docker in the previous section.

### Prepare the Environment

Ensure you have the necessary environment variable `ETHEREUM_API_URL` set. You can set this in your shell or in a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
export ETHEREUM_API_URL="your-ethereum-api-url"
```

Or create a `.env` file:

```
ETHEREUM_API_URL=your-ethereum-api-url
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  When running with `sudo`, environment variables set in the current session might not be carried over. You can pass the variable directly to sudo using the `-E` option to preserve the environment:
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you don't have an L1 endpoint url we recomand you to head up to the
  [Verification](/) section to get one
</Callout>

### Build and Run the Container

Navigate to the cloned Madara repository containing your `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command to build and start the Madara client:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will build the Docker image and start the container in detached mode.

### Check Logs

You can view the logs of the running Madara service using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f Madara
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Now you can head up to the [Metrics](/) section to easily deploy a Grafana and
  Prometheus dashboard
</Callout>

</Steps>

Now that you know how to launch a Madara full node, you might want to set some parameters in order to customize it.
Therefore, you can go to the following section: [Configuration](https://link)
