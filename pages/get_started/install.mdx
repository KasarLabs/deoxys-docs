# Installing Deoxys

In this section, we will guide you through the build and run process so that you can run your own Deoxys client, and query the Starknet blockchain as smoothly as possible.

We want anyone to be able to launch a Deoxys full node, which is why we've divided this section into 3 difficulty levels:
- [**High-level**](#high-level-installation-clicknplay) (from the Deoxys click'n'play app)
- [**Mid-level**](#mid-level-installation-from-docker) (from Docker)
- [**Low-level**](#low-level-installation-from-source) (from source directly).

## High level installation (click'n'play)

The easiest way to run Deoxys without any prior coding skills or terminal aknowledgments is the click'n'play solution from the Deoxys App.
You just need to install it, fill out your parameters and enjoy!

<Steps>

### Install Deoxys App

We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

## Mid level installation (from docker)



<Steps>

### Install dependencies


| Dependency  |  Version | Linux | MacOs | Windows
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Docker  | rustc 1.69.0-nightly  | [Download](link) | [Download](link) | [Download](link) |


### Get

Fetch the code from the Official [Deoxys](https://github.com/KasarLabs/deoxys) repository in the folder of your choice.

```bash
cd <your-destination-path>
git clone https://github.com/KasarLabs/deoxys
```

### Build

Then let's build the dependencies in `release` mode

```bash
cd deoxys
cargo build --release
```

### Run

**Single-Node Development Chain**

This command will start the Deoxys client which will begin the synchronization with the Starknet network automatically:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --dev --sealing=manual 
```
