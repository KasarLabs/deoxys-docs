### Hardware Requirements

For optimal performance of Deoxys, the following hardware configurations are recommended:

| Network                 	| Memory | CPU Cores |
|---------------------------|:------:|:---------:|
| **Mainnet**     			| 16 GB  | 4         |
| **Testnet (Sepolia)**     | 8 GB 	 | 4         |
| **Appchains**        		| 8 GB   | 4         |

### Disk Requirements

A Deoxys full node requires at least **256 GB** of fast disk storage, such as NVMe or a high-speed SSD, to function properly. We recommend **512 GB** for reduced maintenance and greater peace of mind. For specific disk recommendations, consider referring to expert reviews and guides in the context of the Starknet network.

#### Database Growth

Upon a fresh synchronization with Starknet mainnet, Deoxys requires around **256 GB** of disk space, and this requirement will increase as the blockchain expands. Post-sync, expect the database to grow by approximately **2 GB** weekly. To manage this, periodic resyncing or pruning may be necessary. A larger disk reduces the frequency of this maintenance, providing a buffer for chain growth.

#### Disk Speed

For Deoxys nodes, disk speed is a critical performance factor. We recommend using disks with a minimum of 10,000 IOPS for read and write operations to avoid sync bottlenecks and ensure swift operation.

#### Sync Modes and Disk Usage

The sync mode selected for Deoxys can greatly affect disk usage:

- **Archive Node:** This retains the entire blockchain history and requires substantial storage.
- **Pruned Node:** Deoxys will allow for older block information to be pruned to save space while still supporting the essential functionality of the network.
- **Full Node:** A non-archive but complete node retains all necessary data for current operations but does not store the entirety of the chain's history. This is basically an archive node without receipts.

For further details, it's advisable to refer to the specific documentation regarding Deoxys' implementation of these modes.
