### Hardware Requirements

For optimal performance of Madara, the following hardware configurations are recommended:

| Network               | Memory | CPU Cores |
| --------------------- | :----: | :-------: |
| **Mainnet**           | 16 GB  |     4     |
| **Testnet (Sepolia)** |  8 GB  |     4     |
| **Appchains**         |  8 GB  |     4     |

### Disk Requirements

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer']}>
	<Tab>
		A Madara full node requires at least **256 GB** of fast disk storage, such as NVMe or a high-speed SSD, to function properly. We recommend **512 GB** for reduced maintenance and greater peace of mind. For specific disk recommendations, consider referring to expert reviews and guides in the context of the Starknet network.
	</Tab>
	<Tab>
		We advise you to use the same specs as for Starknet mainnet as mentioned in the full node section, but depending on your app chain traffic these figures may change.
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Database Growth

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer']}>
	<Tab>
		Upon a fresh synchronization with Starknet mainnet, Madara requires around **256 GB** of disk space, and this requirement will increase as the blockchain expands. Post-sync, expect the database to grow by approximately **2 GB** weekly. To manage this, periodic resyncing or pruning may be necessary. A larger disk reduces the frequency of this maintenance, providing a buffer for chain growth.

	</Tab>

#### Disk Speed

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Tabs items={['Full Node', 'Sequencer']}>
	<Tab>
		For Madara nodes, disk speed is a critical performance factor. We recommend using disks with a minimum of 10,000 IOPS for read and write operations to avoid sync bottlenecks and ensure swift operation.

#### Sync Modes and Disk Usage

The sync mode selected for Madara can greatly affect disk usage:

- **Archive Node:** This retains the entire blockchain history and requires substantial storage.
- **Pruned Node:** Madara will allow for older block information to be pruned to save space while still supporting the essential functionality of the network (not supported yet).

For further details, it's advisable to refer to the specific documentation regarding Madara' implementation of these modes.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Madara currently supports **Full node** mode only in production.
