## Hardware Requirements

For optimal performance of Deoxys, the following hardware configurations are recommended:

| Network                 | Memory | CPU Cores |
|-------------------------|:------:|:---------:|
| **Primary Network**     | 16 GB  | 4         |
| **Primary Archive**     | 128 GB | 8         |
| **Test Network**        | 8 GB   | 2         |
| **Test Archive**        | 8 GB   | 4         |
| **Specialized Chains**  | 16 GB  | 2         |
| **Alternate Networks**  | 8 GB   | 2         |

### Disk Requirements

A Deoxys full node requires at least 1 TB of fast disk storage, such as NVMe or a high-speed SSD, to function properly. **We recommend 2 TB** for reduced maintenance and greater peace of mind. For specific disk recommendations, consider referring to expert reviews and guides in the context of substrate-based networks.

#### Database Growth

Upon a fresh synchronization with the primary blockchain network, Deoxys requires around 504 GB of disk space, and this requirement will increase as the blockchain expands. Post-sync, expect the database to grow by approximately 27 GB weekly. To manage this, periodic resyncing or pruning may be necessary. A larger disk reduces the frequency of this maintenance, providing a buffer for chain growth.

#### Disk Speed

For Deoxys nodes, disk speed is a critical performance factor. We recommend using disks with a minimum of 10,000 IOPS for read and write operations to avoid sync bottlenecks and ensure swift operation.

#### Sync Modes and Disk Usage

The sync mode selected for Deoxys can greatly affect disk usage:

- **Archive Node:** This retains the entire blockchain history and requires substantial storage, which as of the latest update, means at least 14 TB, increasing by about 60 GB weekly.
- **Pruned Node:** Deoxys, like Substrate, allows for older block information to be pruned to save space while still supporting the essential functionality of the network.
- **Full Node:** A non-archive but complete node retains all necessary data for current operations but does not store the entirety of the chain's history.

For further details, it's advisable to refer to the specific documentation regarding Deoxys' implementation of these modes.
