# Updating Madara

In this section, we will guide you through the update process so that you can keep your Madara client up-to-date and continue to query the Starknet blockchain smoothly.

Depending on how you chose to launch your client, you can update it in the same way by choosing the appropriate category:

- [**Low-level**](#low-level-update-from-source) (from source directly)
- [**Mid-level**](#mid-level-update) (from Docker **recommended**)
- [**High-level**](#high-level-update-clicknplay) (Coming soon)

## Low level Update

## From source

<Steps>
### Update code

First, navigate to your Madara project directory and fetch the latest changes from the Official [Madara](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/madara) repository. Or git checkout to your desired version.

```bash
cd <your-destination-path>
git pull origin main
```

### Rebuild program

Then let's rebuild the program. You can choose between 3 different build modes:

- **Debug** (fastest build mode, but lower performances, for testing purpose only)

```bash
cargo build
```

- **Release** (the recommended build mode with production performances)

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Restart Madara

This command will restart the Madara client with a basic set of arguments which will continue the synchronization with Starknet mainnet automatically:

```bash
cargo run --release \
  --name Madara \
  --base-path /var/lib/madara \
  --network main \
  --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
```

  We recommend you to head up to the [Configuration](/) section to customize your
  node parameters.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  If you don't have an L1 endpoint URL, we recommend you to head up to the
  [Verification](/) section to get one.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Mid level Update

This is the recommended way to easily update and run Madara; it only requires terminal access.

## Using Docker

<Steps>

### Pull latest Docker image

Ensure you have Docker installed and running. Then, pull the latest Madara Docker image.

```bash
docker pull madara:latest
```

### Stop and remove old container

Stop and remove the existing Madara container to prevent conflicts.

```bash
docker stop madara
docker rm madara
```

### Run updated Docker image

Run the updated Madara image with your desired parameters.

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name Madara
  -p 9944:9944 \
  -v /var/lib/madara:/var/lib/madara \
  madara:latest \
  --base-path /var/lib/Madara \
  --network main \
  --l1-endpoint ${ETHEREUM_API_URL}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This is a default configuration. For more information on possible
  configurations, please visit the
  [Configuration](../fundamentals/configuration) section.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Make sure to change the volume `-v` of your container if you change the
  `--base-path`.
</Callout>

### Check logs

```bash
docker logs -f madara
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Now you can head up to the [Metrics](/) section to easily deploy a Grafana and
  Prometheus dashboard.
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Using Docker Compose

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Pull latest Docker image

Navigate to the cloned Madara repository and pull the latest Docker image.

```bash
docker-compose pull
```

### Restart the Container

Stop the current container and start the updated one.

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Check Logs

You can view the logs of the running Madara service using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f madara
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Now you can head up to the [Metrics](/) section to easily deploy a Grafana and
  Prometheus dashboard.
</Callout>

</Steps>

Now that you know how to update a Madara full node, you might want to set some parameters in order to customize it.
