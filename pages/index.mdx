# Introduction and overview

Welcome to the Madara documentation. Madara is a powerful and fully open-source implementation of a hybrid full node client and sequencer written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the Starknet network.

Built with passion by the core developers of Starknet, Madara is an open-source stack that allows you to create custom Appchains using Cairo technology, providing powerful performance, high modularity, and unprecedented ease in switching from a Starknet client to your own zk-powered chains.

This documentation provides everything you need to know about setting up, configuring, and using the Madara Client. It's organized topically, making it simple to find exactly what you need, complete with comprehensive examples and clear illustrations to guide your use of the Madara Client.

Your experience and feedback are invaluable to us, and we encourage your input to further refine the Madara Client and this documentation. Thank you for choosing Madara, and we look forward to supporting your Starknet journey.
