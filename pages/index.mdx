# Introduction and overview

Welcome to the Madara documentation. Madara is a powerful and fully open-source implementation of a hybrid full node client and sequencer written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for the Starknet network.

Built by the [Kasar](https://kasar.io) laboratory, our goal, beyond providing diversity and performances, is to make it easy to launch and manage a Starknet full node client by seeking the perfect harmony between storage, sync time, and RPC latency, while providing a high-level tooling suit. With an easy and quick access to the Starknet state, so that any rpc provider, company, or individual can benefit from it.

This documentation provides everything you need to know about setting up, configuring, and using the Madara Client. It's organized topically, making it simple to find exactly what you need, complete with comprehensive examples and clear illustrations to guide your use of the Madara Client.

Your experience and feedback are invaluable to us, and we encourage your input to further refine the Madara Client and this documentation. Thank you for choosing Madara, and we look forward to supporting your Starknet journey.
