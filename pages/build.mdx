# Build upon Deoxys

*Professor Oak* <br></br>In this section, we will guide you through the build and run process so that you can run your own Deoxys client, and query the Starknet blockchain as smoothly as possible.

## Let's start

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

We first need to make sure you have everything needed to complete this tutorial.

| Dependency  |  Version | Installation |
|---|---|---|
| Rust  | rustc 1.69.0-nightly  | `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs \| sh` <br></br>`rustup toolchain install nightly` |
| nvm  | latest  | `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh \| bash` |
| Cairo  | 1.0  | `curl -L https://github.com/franalgaba/cairo-installer/raw/main/bin/cairo-installer \| bash` |




### Run your own node

Fetch the code from the Official [Deoxys](https://github.com/KasarLabs/deoxys) repository in the folder of your choice.

```bash
cd <your-folder>
git clone https://github.com/KasarLabs/deoxys
```

Then let's build the dependencies in `release` mode

```bash
cd deoxys
cargo build --release
```

**Single-Node Development Chain**

This command will start the Deoxys client which will begin the synchronization with the Starknet network automatically:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --dev --sealing=manual 
```

If everything works correctly, we can go to the next step and create our peer to peer network!

### Create your peer to peer network

{/* First, run this command to create a plain chain spec

```bash
./target/release/madara build-spec > ./infra/chain-sepcs/chain-spec-plain.json
```

By default, the chain will run with the following config :
- [GRANDPA & AURA](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/consensus/#default-consensus-models)
- An `admin` account contract at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`
- A test contract at address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001111`
- A fee token (ETH) at address `0x040e59c2c182a58fb0a74349bfa4769cbbcba32547591dd3fb1def8623997d00`
- The `admin` account address has a `MAX` balance of fee token
- An ERC20 contract at address `0x040e59c2c182a58fb0a74349bfa4769cbbcba32547591dd3fb1def8623997d00`

This chain specification can be thought of as the main source of information that will be used when connecting to the chain. 

### *(Not available yet) Deploy your settlement smart contracts*

### Start your chain

Now that we are all setup, we can finally run the chain! ðŸ‘½

There are a lot of ways you can run the chain depending on which role you want to take :
- **Full node**<br></br>
Synchronizes with the chain to store the most recent block state and block headers for older blocks.
- **Archive node**<br></br>
Maintains all blocks starting from the genesis block with complete state available for every block.
- **RPC node**<br></br>
Exposes an RPC interface over HTTP or WebSocket ports for the chain so that users can read the blockchain state and submit transactions. 
There are often multiple RPC nodes behind a load balancer.
- **Validator node**<br></br>
Secures the chain by staking some chosen asset and votes on consensus along with other validators.

When developing your chain, you can simply run it in developer mode :

```bash
./target/release/madara --dev --execution=native
```

If you only care about exposing the RPC you can run the following : 
```bash
./target/release/madara --unsafe-ws-external --rpc-methods Safe --rpc-cors â€˜*â€™ --ws-max-connections 5000
```

If you want to keep the whole state of the chain in a `/tmp/ folder :
```bash
./target/release/madara --base-path /tmp/
```

In this case, note that you can purge the chain's state whenever you like by running : 
```bash
./target/release/madara purge-chain --base-path /tmp
```

### Deploy an account on your chain

Ooook, now your chain is finally running. It's time to deploy your own account!



### Make some transactions
